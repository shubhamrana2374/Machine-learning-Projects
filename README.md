# Machine-learning-Projects

The analysis of the Celebrity dataset for the hair color prediction using various machine learning algorithms. 
The analysis has been done on a cut down version of the original dataset to fasten the process. Initially, conventional machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, SVM, neural networks had been used and pick the best one.

Furthermore, a deep machine learning model such as a fully connected dense model had been used and predictive analysis performed on the public and private datasets.

(The dataset is quite large to upload here, so I am using the google drive.
